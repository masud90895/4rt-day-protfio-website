            <h3>World Class proffetional web-devloper</h3>
            <p>let me introduce myself. My name is Md. Mahafujur Rahaman Masud, and I’m a full-time front end developer with 1 years experience. In that time, I’ve worked as a front-end developer for both a Forbes 500 consulting firm and a small company. This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because I had no real experience doing web development — and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training I got from a few online courses. I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I graduated with a degree in IT project management</p>

            <p>i allready learned the basic html and css.I can build any simple website.I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website.my goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.Web development and web design share many commonalities, but they differ in some key areas. Web design deals with the front-end of a website, concerning itself with appearance and user experience. Web development, on the other hand, deals with building technical front-end and/or back-end code that informs site function.</p>
